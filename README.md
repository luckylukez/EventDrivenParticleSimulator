# Event driven simulator for particles with independent and arbitrary paths
Remember the LAN-party times, this is a atempt to find back to that feeling.
This project was finnsihed during an "all nighter", even though the rough ideas, together with
the skeleton code, were laid out some time prior to this.

The project is base upon the relatively simple idea of an event based particle simulator, bur
with some added bells an whistles. A simulator where the particles only interact with each other, without any loss of
energy, is straigh up boring. Introducing gravity makes it a bit spicier, but still, kind of boring. We are therefore proud to present a
particle simulator where each particle can be assigned to travel along a unique paraetrsised arbitrary path.
